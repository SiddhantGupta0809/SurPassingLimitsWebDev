            <h4>Commenting</h4>
            <p>
                Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are
                written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create.
                With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand
                where things are at and how they work.

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
